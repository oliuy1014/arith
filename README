Architecture:
- image_pixmap_convert: 
-- reads pixmap from ppm image, converts pixmap to ppm and writes to stdout
- rgb_vcs_convert:
-- converts between rgb values and video color space values (VCS)
- vcs_blockavg_convert:
-- converts between block data (a, b, c, d, pb, pr) and VCS
- blockavg_codeword_convert:
-- converts between block data and 32-bit codewords
- read_write_codewords:
-- writes compressed image codewords to stdout, reads compressed file in
- bitpack:
-- interface used to pack integers into fields in a 32-bit codeword
-- functions to insert, update and retrieve those values

Implemented: We believe all has been implemented correctly :)
